Data Scientist,-1,"Why are we building Urban Company?
Organised service commerce is a large yet young industry in India. While India is a very large market for home and local services (~USD 50 Billion in retail spends) and expected to double in the next 5 years, there is no billion-dollar company in this segment today. The industry is barely ~20 years old, with a sub-optimal market architecture typical of an unorganised market – fragmented supply side operated by middlemen. As a result, experiences are broken for both customers and service professionals, each largely relying upon word of mouth to discover the other. The industry can easily be 1.5-2x larger than it is today, if the frictions in user and professional’s journeys are removed – and the experiences made more meaningful and joyful.
Urban Company is a “services platform”, with the bold ambition to organize the key verticals within the service commerce industry, bringing in the benefits of scale - structured processes, systems, standardisation, transparency and trust. This platform will enable billions of dollars in commerce annually, and create jobs for 1 million+ service professionals. The key industries that we are going to organize over the next few years include – home improvement, home maintenance & repairs, appliance repairs, salon spa & makeup services, fitness & health at home, academic tuitions, photography & events, packing & moving etc.

As a Data Scientist, you would play a critical role in developing and then implementing Advanced Analytics solutions on production
systems. The role would involve building cutting edge solutions for match making, capacity planning, demand prediction, fraud identification, solving for disintermediation and churn prediction etc.

Potential hires are expected to own the end to end process right from development to implementation – data extraction, text analytics, feature engineering, model building, and model testing, clear model and implementation documentation/codes and work with Engineers to help operationalize the solution into live systems.
Key Data problems we are solving
Matching the right professional for each customer request (match making)
Quantifying how many requests were lost based on drop in conversion due to unavailable slots. Use this data for onboarding providers at hyper local level (capacity planning)
Using various signals to find out fraud / disintermediation on the platform (Fraud detection)
Customer Segmentation. Computing state of customer after each interaction.Use customer segment for home screen personalization and campaigns (personalization)
Not taking those requests where we have predicted that no partner is going to respond. Stopping bad customer experience as a result (customer experience)
Identifying providers who are going to get churned and try to retain them (partner retention)
Job responsibilities
Breaking up big business problem into small actionable Analytical/Data Science problems
Give thought leadership on problem definition and defining the key metrics to target
Identify the important input variables/data needed for model building
Design the Validation metric to evaluate machine learning models
Do the feature engineering and build the model.
Move the model into production as a micro service.
Ability to work on multiple projects in parallel
Prepare dashboards to track performance and responsiveness of the model in production
Job requirements
Overall experience of 2-5 yrs. in Advanced Analytics/ Business Intelligence/Data Warehousing

Data Scientist (Content Intelligence),-1,"ShareChat is India’s largest regional social media platform that provides a comfortable digital space for the next generation of Internet users who want to use the Internet in their native language. It is a platform that helps people share their thoughts, emotions, opinions and discover friends without any language barrier. Founded in 2015, ShareChat offers an easy content consumption and sharing platform in 15 Indian languages. Being an online medium for India’s newest internet users, our platform sees a massive amount of variety in terms of content shared – text, photographs, video content and a wide range of discourses that range from weekend forwards to political conversations to celebrity updates to local festivals. In a nutshell, ShareChat is at the forefront of the vernacular social media revolution and we want to redefine the way billions of people are consuming content on social media.

AI @ ShareChat


India’s active internet user population has crossed half a billion in 2019. If you look closely at the first 100 million Internet users and the rest of the users who came online in the last few years, you will notice stark differences in their needs and wants from the Internet. While the first generation Internet users in India weren’t too different from Internet users in the rest of the world, the next wave of users are truly unique in a number of ways. A huge chunk of audience is regional language first audience and therefore wants to consume content and services in their native language. Their taste in content also happens to be vastly different – we observe a long tail of content genres emerging that didn’t exist previously. Despite the internet growing so swiftly, many Indian Internet users are not comfortable with searching on the internet or finding whom to follow in order to satisfy their information needs. A radically simplified paradigm for content delivery is needed for this audience – one that automatically learns the user’s taste and pushes the right content at the right time to them based on their interest. ShareChat harnesses AI in its quest towards this mission possible.

AI @ ShareChat


India’s active internet user population has crossed half a billion in 2019. If you look closely at the first 100 million Internet users and the rest of the users who came online in the last few years, you will notice stark differences in their needs and wants from the Internet. While the first generation Internet users in India weren’t too different from Internet users in the rest of the world, the next wave of users are truly unique in a number of ways. A huge chunk of audience isregional language first audience and therefore wants to consume content and services in their native language. Their taste in content also happens to be vastly different – we observe a long tail of content genres emerging that didn’t exist previously. Despite the internet growing so swiftly, many Indian Internet users are not comfortable with searching on the internet or finding whom to follow in order to satisfy their information needs. A radically simplified paradigm for content delivery is needed for this audience – one that automatically learns the user’s taste and pushes the right content at the right time to them based on their interest. ShareChat harnesses AI in its quest towards this mission possible.

Feed Intelligence


The core product value of ShareChat revolves around its algorithmically generated content feeds. Our Feed Intelligence team is in charge of ensuring all feeds in the ShareChat app remain highly engaging for our users at all times, optimising multiple objectives of relevance, freshness, diversity and so on. The team is working to find answers to a number of interesting research questions. Examples include: How do we adapt the mix of content in feeds to optimize for long term user engagement? How to effectively explore users’ preferences over a long tail of content genres where their tastes are highly dynamic?

Content Intelligence


Our Content Intelligence team is focused on developing models that can accurately make sense of posts so that they can be served to a relevant audience. We are investigating different approaches to create unified multimodal representations for a post that capture visual (from images or video), audio and text data from the post. Such a representation for a post should precisely predict how our users interpret the post and what they feel about it.

Data Scientist (Computer Vision),-1,"ShareChat


ShareChat is India’s largest regional social media platform that provides a comfortable digital space for the next generation of Internet users who want to use the Internet in their native language. It is a platform that helps people share their thoughts, emotions, opinions and discover friends without any language barrier. Founded in 2015, ShareChat offers an easy content consumption and sharing platform in 15 Indian languages. Being an online medium for India’s newest internet users, our platform sees a massive amount of variety in terms of content shared – text, photographs, video content and a wide range of discourses that range from weekend forwards to political conversations to celebrity updates to local festivals. In a nutshell, ShareChat is at the forefront of the vernacular social media revolution and we want to redefine the way billions of people are consuming content on social media.

AI @ ShareChat


India’s active internet user population has crossed half a billion in 2019. If you look closely at the first 100 million Internet users and the rest of the users who came online in the last few years, you will notice stark differences in their needs and wants from the Internet. While the first-generation Internet users in India weren’t too different from Internet users in the rest of the world, the next wave of users are truly unique in a number of ways. A huge chunk of audience is regional language first audience and therefore wants to consume content and services in their native language. Their taste in content also happens to be vastly different – we observe a long tail of content genres emerging that didn’t exist previously. Despite the internet growing so swiftly, many Indian Internet users are not comfortable with searching on the internet or finding whom to follow in order to satisfy their information needs. A radically simplified paradigm for content delivery is needed for this audience – one that automatically learns the user’s taste and pushes the right content at the right time to them based on their interest. ShareChat harnesses AI in its quest towards this mission possible.

Camera AI


Our Camera AI team builds unique capabilities in the ShareChat camera to help our users create engaging, original content on our platform. They focus on efficient implementations of capabilities in Computer Vision (e.g., semantic segmentation, super resolution) and Speech Processing so that they can run on mid to low end smartphones. Our mission is to enable every creator, across the long tail of content genres, to unleash the superpowers of AI and be able to create professional grade content.

We’re HIRING!!


The Camera AI team at ShareChat is growing. We are hiring talented individuals with expertise in the areas of Computer Vision, Speech Processing, Augmented Reality and so on. Our team of world class scientists and engineers push the boundaries of state of the art in these areas and impact millions of people every single day.

Lead Data Scientist,-1,"Why are we building Urban Company?
Organised service commerce is a large yet young industry in India. While India is a very large market for home and local services (~USD 50 Billion in retail spends) and expected to double in the next 5 years, there is no billion-dollar company in this segment today. The industry is barely ~20 years old, with a sub-optimal market architecture typical of an unorganised market – fragmented supply side operated by middlemen. As a result, experiences are broken for both customers and service professionals, each largely relying upon word of mouth to discover the other. The industry can easily be 1.5-2x larger than it is today, if the frictions in user and professional’s journeys are removed – and the experiences made more meaningful and joyful.
Urban Company is a “services platform”, with the bold ambition to organize the key verticals within the service commerce industry, bringing in the benefits of scale - structured processes, systems, standardisation, transparency and trust. This platform will enable billions of dollars in commerce annually, and create jobs for 1 million+ service professionals. The key industries that we are going to organize over the next few years include – home improvement, home maintenance & repairs, appliance repairs, salon spa & makeup services, fitness & health at home, academic tuitions, photography & events, packing & moving etc.
